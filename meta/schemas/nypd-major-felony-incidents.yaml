title: NYPD 7 Major Felony Incidents


caveats:
    - Offenses that lack an X coordinate and Y coordinate are geo-coded as occurring at the police station house within the precinct of occurrence.

    -  Rape offenses are geo-coded as occurring at the police station house within the precinct of occurrence.

    - The CompStat Month, Day and Year represent the date the incident was reported to the NYPD and subsequently entered into the Department's record management system. Data presented here are based on the year the incident was reported, not necessarily when it occurred. The result is that some crimes listed here were reported during this time, but may have occurred in a previous year.


    - The Hour of Occurrence is based on the 24-hour clock. 0000 hours represents 12:00am through 12:59am, 0100 hours represents 1:00am through 1:59am, etc.
